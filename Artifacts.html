      <p>Descrpition:
      This was a timed essay where our class wrote about the colonies in the time of the enlightenment.
      Reflection: I included this artifact because I believe it greatly reflects my strength, which I set as essay writing. I was very proud of my grade, as it was agreat improvement from my porevious essay, where I was very dissapointed in my grade.I used my organizational skills for my thinking map, which I was usuaklly struggle with. However, in this essay I worked very hard to create a plan before I actually wrote my essay. Through this, I exbhited good habits of mind with being organized </p>
      <h2> Literature Artifact:
          Scarlet letter essay
      </h2>
      <figure><img src ="images/IMG_2052.JPG"><figcaption>My Literature Essay</figcaption></figure> <img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg">       <p>Description: After reading the Scarlet Letter, our class was called to write an essay about the novel. There was a variety of prompts, but I chose to wtrite about the symbolism of nature. 
      Reflection: I added this artifact because of all the effort I put in it. I think this essay reflects my SMART goal, which is grammar. I had little to no grammar mistakes and a variety of sentence structure. And aklthough there is always room for improvement, i thought it was a great essay, that exhibted good habits of mind.</p>
      
      <h2> Math Artifact: Chapter 7 Test</h2>
      <figure><img src ="images/IMG_2272.JPG"><figcaption>My Math Test</figcaption></figure><img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg">       <p>Description: After reviewing our chapter for the month, my class had to take a test about parallelograms and classifying them.
      Reflection: I belive I showed good habits of mind. I had'nt been at class the whole week leading up to the test, where they reviewed important concepts. I asked my friends for notes and to help me understand the concepts. Additionally I contacted my teacher to tell them that I could'nt take the test on that Friday. Through this I was able to gain more time to study and understand the chapter. And my final grade was something I was very happy with.</p>
      
      <h2> Spanish Artifact: Presentation</h2>
 <figure> <img src ="images/IMG_0987.PNG"><figcaption>My Spanish presentation</figcaption></figure> <img class = "body" src ="images/Design.jpg">      <p>Descrpition: In order to practice our spanish, Sra. Rozas had our class do a presentation about our recent lesson: En el Consolturio.
      Reflection: I believe this project shows me overcoming my stretch, as the presentation was with a partner, and my stretch was collabroation. Of course it was very beneficially that I had a close friend as my partner, however, I still found it difficult to convey my ideas. But, I was able to overcome this, as our project ended up being very good, and our presentation met all the requirements. Additionally, we had to memorize our scripts, and my partner and I did this, therefore showing good habits of mind.  </p>
