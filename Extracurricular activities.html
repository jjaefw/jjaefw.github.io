      <p>I played soccer for most of this year, and it was a lot of fun, however I decided to move on from soccer and focus more on my community. I still run very often though, and am looking to do cross country in high school.</p>

      <p> I draw and paint, and this may be just a hobby but I find it very calming. In highschool I hope to take art and perhaps join the art conservatory. </p>

      <p>I am apart of an organization called 4-h, where I take Public Speaking and Cooking classes. It also provides many volunteering opportunities.      </p>
